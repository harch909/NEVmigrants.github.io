<p>A safe environment for women to enjoy each other's company, make new friends and learn more about living in Dunedin. These are the aims of this new women's multi-cultural group in the Valley. Co-ordinator Afife Harris says the group offers a social support network to people of all nationalities in and around Dunedin. "We are a friendly group of women who have international connections. Some of us have come to live in Dunedin from other parts of the world and others have lived or worked abroad". The group has just started up and meets weekly at the Valley Project community rooms. There are plans to organise trips to museums and other places of local interest, such as community gardens, to have speakers, share pot-luck meals and run cooking sessions.</p>
